This is the ReadMe file for Ricardo Maury's "Sieve of Eratosthenes" Program.

(The program was completed in PuTTy on the ocelot.aul.fiu.edu server)

How to compile the program:

-There are 3 files needed: main.c, sieveFunctions.c, and sieve.h

-Once the files are gathered in the same directory, it must be compiled with the gcc compiler as such:

"gcc main.c sieveFunctions.c -lm" 

It will result in a "a.out" file. To execute, write:

"./a.out"
